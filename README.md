Unity 3D Utility Kit
====================

This project provides a few useful scripts for use with the game engine Unity.  Some of the samples are my own work and others are collected from public forums and blogs if I think the code is useful.

Property Attributes
-------------------

These are Inspector tags that change the behaviour of properties in the inspector.

  * ToolTips that work for nearly all Unity property types.
  * ToolBox that adds a description in the inspector panel.
  * Int Ranges that add a slider to both integers and floats using whole number steps.
  * Divider that draws a line across the inspector pane and optionally adds a heading
  * Scene name list that shows the scenes included in the build settings.  
  
There are others too.

Additions
---------

I'll add more stuff as I code things that may be useful.
